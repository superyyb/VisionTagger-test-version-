Part 2.Winston Video
After watching Winston’s video, I identified five specific techniques that I will apply in
presenting our VisionTagger Final Project.

(1) Begin with an Empowerment Promise (Winston’s “Promise” Principle)
Winston emphasizes starting with an empowerment promise — telling the audience what they will
learn or be able to do by the end of the talk. This creates motivation and primes them to listen
with purpose.
At the start of my VisionTagger presentation, I will briefly promise the audience that by the end
they will clearly understand how VisionTagger analyzes images and how the MVC + Service Layer
architecture enables extensibility.


(2) Use Verbal Punctuation to Structure the Talk Clearly
Winston recommends using “verbal punctuation” — explicit structural markers like first, next, finally
— so listeners never get lost, even if they miss a part of the talk.
When presenting the system architecture, I will explicitly break it into three main segments:
Model and immutable data structures
Service layer and controller orchestration
View implementations (Console, JSON, Swing, SwingPro)
Each transition will be clearly signposted so the audience can follow the design flow without confusion.

(3) Cycle Key Ideas
Winston stresses the importance of cycling — repeating essential points at least three times in
different ways so the audience retains them.
The message I will cycle is:
“VisionTagger is architected for extensibility through interfaces and clean separation of concerns.”
This helps ensure the core concept stays memorable.

(4) Use Diagrams Instead of Dense Text (Slides Support the Speaker, Not Replace Them)
Winston warns against putting too much text on slides; the audience cannot read and listen
simultaneously. Slides should amplify the speaker.
For the class diagram and architecture, I will avoid copying large blocks of text from Part 1.
Instead, I will show:
a simplified class diagram with arrows illustrating flow between Controller → Service Layer → View
highlight colors for interfaces vs. implementations, which allows me to verbally explain the logic.

(5) Fence the Idea — Clarify What the Project Is and Is Not
Winston teaches the technique of “fencing”: draw clear boundaries so the audience does not confuse
your idea with something else.
Early in the presentation, I will define VisionTagger by stating both what it is and is not:
VisionTagger is a modular image‐labeling system that supports multiple views and a pluggable
analysis engine, and it is not a full machine-learning model; the analyzer is intentionally
abstracted so any implementation (mock, AWS, local ML) can be plugged in.
